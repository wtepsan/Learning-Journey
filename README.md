In this repository, I intended to put codes that I have learned from various of resources about Neural Netwrok by using PyTorch. 
Hope it will be useful for you. There are the following code files:

1. 1_Intro2NN.py --> Understand Basic Neural Network
2. FistNNPyTorch.py --> Define an easy and simple Neural Networks by using PyTorch.
3. Other.py --> Other stuffs.
